CIFAR-10 Image Classification using a Convolutional Neural Network
This repository contains a simple, yet effective, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. This project serves as an excellent starting point for anyone looking to understand the fundamentals of CNNs for computer vision tasks.

üöÄ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to train a CNN to accurately classify 32x32 color images into one of 10 categories from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The process involves data preprocessing, defining a CNN architecture, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

üñºÔ∏è Dataset: CIFAR-10
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark in computer vision. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

The 10 classes are:

0: airplane

1: automobile

2: bird

3: cat

4: deer

5: dog

6: frog

7: horse

8: ship

9: truck

üß† Model Architecture
The CNN model is built using tf.keras.Sequential and is composed of a series of convolutional, pooling, flattening, and dense layers.

Purpose

Conv2D

filters=32, kernel_size=(3,3)

relu

Extracts low-level features like edges and textures.

MaxPooling2D

pool_size=(2,2)

N/A

Downsamples the feature maps, reducing spatial dimensions and computational cost.

Conv2D

filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3)

relu

Extracts more complex features from the downsampled maps.

MaxPooling2D

pool_size=(2,2)

N/A

Further downsamples the feature maps.

Conv2D

filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3)

relu

Continues to refine and extract high-level features.

Flatten

N/A

N/A

Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector to be fed into the dense layers.

Dense

units=64

relu

A fully-connected layer for learning non-linear relationships.

Dense

units=10

softmax

The output layer, producing a probability distribution over the 10 classes.

üöÄ Usage
The code provided loads the CIFAR-10 dataset, preprocesses the data (normalization and one-hot encoding), defines the CNN model, and trains it for 5 epochs. You can run the code cell by cell in a Jupyter Notebook to see each step of the process.

üìä Results
After training for 5 epochs, the model achieved the following performance metrics on the test data:

Test Loss: 1.3281

Test Accuracy: 0.52999997 (approximately 53%)

The validation accuracy was slightly higher, indicating that the model performed slightly better on the validation split of the training data than on the unseen test data.
