CIFAR-10 Image Classification using a Convolutional Neural Network
This repository contains a simple, yet effective, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. This project serves as an excellent starting point for anyone looking to understand the fundamentals of CNNs for computer vision tasks.

üöÄ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to train a CNN to accurately classify 32x32 color images into one of 10 categories from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The process involves data preprocessing, defining a CNN architecture, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

üñºÔ∏è Dataset: CIFAR-10
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark in computer vision. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

The 10 classes are:

0: airplane

1: automobile

2: bird

3: cat

4: deer

5: dog

6: frog

7: horse

8: ship

9: truck

üß† Model Architecture

NLP

Basic NLP Text Classifier with TensorFlow
This is a simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that demonstrates how to build a text classification model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained to classify short sentences as either "positive" or "negative" based on a small, hardcoded dataset.

Features
Simple Dataset: The project uses a small, in-memory list of sentences and corresponding labels to make it easy to understand and get started.

Text Preprocessing: It includes steps for tokenization and padding, which are essential for converting raw text into a numerical format that a neural network can process.

Neural Network Model: A basic sequential model is built using an Embedding layer, a GlobalAveragePooling1D layer, and Dense layers. This is a common and effective architecture for simple text classification tasks.

Training and Prediction: The script compiles and trains the model, and then uses it to make predictions on new, unseen sentences.

How to Run
Prerequisites
You only need one library to run this project:

tensorflow

You can install it using pip:

pip install tensorflow

Execution
Save the Python code provided as nlp_project.py.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

Run the script using the Python interpreter:

python nlp_project.py

The script will print the word index, the padded sequences, a summary of the model, and the final predictions for the test sentences.

Code Explanation
The script is divided into a few key sections:

Dataset Preparation: A hardcoded list of sentences and their corresponding labels (1 for positive, 0 for negative) is defined.

Tokenization & Padding:

Tokenizer: This class converts each unique word in the dataset into a unique integer.

pad_sequences: This function ensures all sentences have the same length by adding zeros, which is a requirement for the neural network.

Model Architecture:

Embedding: This is the first layer. It learns a dense vector representation for each word.

GlobalAveragePooling1D: This layer averages the word vectors in a sentence to create a single, fixed-length vector.

Dense: These are standard, fully connected layers that perform the final classification.

Training & Evaluation:

model.compile(): Configures the model for training with a specific loss function, optimizer, and metrics.

model.fit(): Trains the model on the prepared dataset for a specified number of epochs.

Prediction: The trained model is used to predict the sentiment of new sentences that it has never seen before.

Potential Enhancements
This project can be expanded in many ways. You could:

Use a Larger Dataset: Load a real-world dataset, like the IMDb movie reviews, using tensorflow_datasets.

Try Different Architectures: Experiment with more complex layers like LSTM or GRU to see how they affect performance.

Improve Preprocessing: Add more advanced steps like removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, or using stemming.

The validation accuracy was slightly higher, indicating that the model performed slightly better on the validation split of the training data than on the unseen test data.
